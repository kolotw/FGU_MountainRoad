Supported URP version: 12.1.6

The imported URP package includes URP materials / shader versions for all materials in the v3.2+ scene. that use custom shaders 

V3.2+ Demo Scene Steps:

1) Upgrade built-in materials to URP:
   Window > Rendering > Render Pipeline > Render Pipeline Converter

2) Select the Directional Light object, this should update the lighting if necessary

3) Terrain, when the terrain is not updated a new terrain material can be assigned using the URP or HDRP TerrainLit shader

URP support was added in v3.2. The older v3.1 demo scene includes older legacy shaders and is not fully optimized for URP. If there are assets in this scene that you want to use, fixing the pink materials is a matter of assigning one of the v3.2 shaders.
